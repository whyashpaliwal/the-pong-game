            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Hey I'm Yash and Welcome to the my Pong game, The Pong Game is very simple and 
                easy to play. All you need is a laptop and as this is coded in
                client side so you dont need to have a stable internet connection once the 
                game is loaded just don't refresh your browser window;
                <br>
                This Game is a demonstration of the functionalities of a new technology I am learning right now.
                <br>
                Hope you will enjoy it :)
            </p>
